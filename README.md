TicTacToe
=========

Simple Android TicTacToe Game

This is a very basic Android Tic Tac Toe game.  The purpose of this is to introduce beginners to android development.
I hope in the future to add more comments, make variables more clear, etc. to make it easier for one to learn.

I also plan on adding more features to the game, including:  
*counting how many wins X and O has  
*make a nicer looking board  
*use images as X and O  
*more professional layout
